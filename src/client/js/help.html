        Paste you json and then provide a lodash based expression (Not limited to lodash only , any javascript
        expression can be used) , then click the <strong>Run</strong> button to evaluate the expression.

        The object <strong>jsonObj</strong> is the java object created from the entered json and we can play with this
        object in the expression.

    <h3><u>Usage</u></h3>

        </li>
        <li>
            Analyze test data for creating mocks, stubs etc.

    </p>
    <p>
        Note: This website uses lodash 4.1.5 as is without any modification, we will move to higher versions as and
        when lodash releases one.

    <h4>Slow ?</h4>
    If the UI feels slow when processing huge JSON , try <a target="_blank"
                                                            href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/products/">firefox</a>
    which will definitely provide better performance.
    Meanwhile we are working on a server side processing so that the browser is not bothered with intensive data
    processing.....

        <h2>Lodash</h2>
        Lodash is an excellent utility providing a large set of capabilities to the javascript programming language. It
        is similar to LINQ in .net where javascsript objects can be passed to lodash functions to do sorting, fitering,
        map, search and many many functions.

        Learn more about lodash in its <a target="_blank" href="https://lodash.com/docs/4.15.0">official
        documentation</a>
